            <h1 class="title"> The Life of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h1>

            <p>Shivaji was born in the hilltop fortress of Shivneri near the town of Junnar in what is now the district
                of Pune. Scholars disagree on his date of birth: the Maharashtra government has designated February 19
                as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji His Jayanti). [a][17][18] Shivaji is named after the
                local deity, Goddess Shivai[19][20]. Shivaji's father Shahaji Bonsul was a Maratha general who served
                Deccan Sultan. His mother was Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuj Jadavrao of Sindhked, a Mughal Sardar who
                claimed to be descended from the Yadav royal family of Devagiri.</p>
            <p>The two met on November 10, 1659 at a hut at the foot of Pratapgad Fort. The agreement stipulated that
                each should be armed only with a sword and be accompanied by a squire. Suspecting that Afzal Khan would
                arrest or attack him, Shivaji wore armor under his clothes, concealed a bagnak (a metal "tiger's claw")
                in his left arm, and a dagger in his right hand. had] does not include the exact event. It remains
                entwined with historical certainty and legend of Maratha sources. However, they agree that the hero
                engaged in a physical struggle that proved fatal to the Khan. eviscerated him. He then fired a cannon to
                signal his hidden forces to attack the Bijapuri forces.</p>

            <p>
                Shivaji was crowned king of the Maratha Empire (Hindawi Swaraj) in a lavish ceremony on 6 June 1674 at
                Raigad fort.[112][113] In the Hindu calendar it was on the 13th day (trayodashi) of the first fortnight
                of the month of Jyeshtha in the year 1596.[114] Gaga Bhatt officiated, pouring water from a gold vessel
                filled with the waters of the seven sacred rivers Yamuna, Indus, Ganges, Godavari, Narmada, Krishna and
                Kaveri over Shivaji's head, and chanted the Vedic coronation mantras. After the ablution, Shivaji bowed
                before Jijabai and touched her feet. Nearly fifty thousand people gathered at Raigad for the
                ceremonies.[115][116] Shivaji was entitled Shakakarta ("founder of an era")[1] and Chhatrapati
                ("sovereign"). He also took the title of Haindava Dharmodhhaarak (protector of the Hindu faith)[2] and
                Kshatriya Kulavantas.[117][118][119] Kshatriya is one of the four varnas[f] of Hinduism and kulavantas
                means the 'head of the kula, or race'.
